# StackOverflow-Social-Network-Analysis

This project provides a complete analysis of a social network based on the Question & Answer coming from Stack Exchange
web site and exactly the data science community corresponding to datascience.stackexchange.com, Both networks are based
on the latest data dump from stack Exchange 2017, based on posts (questions) and comments (answers), a directed graph will
be created where nodes are users who either created a post or commented on a post, and a directed edge from user A to user B indicates
that A commented on a post created by B.
